# what follows is the command line that worked for me.
# (some of the settings are superfluous. sorry. i started from the configure that we use for portaudio.)

# IMPORTANT: the part about '-stdlib=libc++' was NOT COOPERATING until i made it part of the CXX (clang++) invocation.
#    (in other words, it was NOT effective to put '-stdlib=libc++' in CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS. it HAD to go in CXX)
